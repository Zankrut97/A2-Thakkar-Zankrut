### Assignment 2 ##

This Assigment focuses on understanding and applying the usability and design principles for overall asethetics of the web application by developing the front-end part. During the implementation of the assignment four pages were developed, they are Home/landing page, which shows all the features of the web application and also all other pages can be navigated through the Home page. Sign-in page, user can login to the web application using email-id and password, all validations are performed.Blogs page shows all the blogs posts in form of card created using Bootstrap and content of each blog can be viewed by clicking on the card also user can search particular blog using search bar. Jobs page shows all the Job post in form of card created using Bootstrap and user can search job based on the role and additional details can be viewed by clicking the card. Additionally "Page not found" page is created and  user will be redirected if they try to visit the page which not exists. Also for the other pages which are not developed by me will show a message.

### Built With ###

[Angular]- web framework used
(https://angular.io/docs) 

[Bootstrap] - Bootstrap components and classes are used for developing certain parts of the web app
(https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)

[Angular Material]- Used for styling and form validation
(https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started) 

[node.js]- package manager
(https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Design Justification ###

**[Fonts / Typography]**

[Google Lato] 
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;0,900;1,400;1,700;1,900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

[Roboto] 
<link
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,500;0,700;0,900;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,700;1,900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

The above two mentioned fonts are the used in the web application. Both the Lato and Roboto fonts belong to sans-serif fonts family. The primary reason for using this font is to improve the readability of small text used in the app. Additionally both the fonts are from same sans-serif family which makes the overall font of the web app consistent.[6] 

**[Background color]**

As observed in some of the modern web apps, the use of single shade as background keeps 
overall look and feel consistent.I have decided to use (#fee3b8) as background color, I have decided to select the light shade as background and the Black colour for majority of text which drives the focus of the user to important text or button in the website. In this web app the primary use of background is to highlight the text or selected button on nav bar. Also the reason behind selecting this #fee3b8 shade is it matches with the images used in the website.

**[Button colour]**

For highlighting the selected the nav bar link the colour used is #fee3b8 as it follows the overall color schema of the webapp.
For submit button (for sign-in) and to navigate to sign-in I have used the bootstrap primary button theme.

**[Cards]**

I have used cards to show the Blog post and Job post. Cards are best way to show the related data of particular blog and job post. It separates the details of a particular blog post from other simailar post so that user can easily find all relevance information at single glance. Also, to highlight the cards I have used box-shawdow property of CSS[7].
